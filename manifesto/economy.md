What policies should we propose to maintain a competitive economy that provides [full employment](http://www.princeton.edu/~achaney/tmve/wiki100k/docs/Full_employment.html)?

## Taxation

### Income Tax

The personal income tax allowance will be set at the level of a full time living wage (currently £14,458.50 based on 252 working days of 7.5 hours per day at £7.65) and will rise inline with the living wage.

Capital Gains Tax will be replaced by an Asset Tax, based on an annual self-assessment. It will apply to those whose assets amount to greater than £350,000. Debt, such as mortgages, will be offset against any assets and the remainder will be assessed as the taxable value of assets. This ensures those who accumulate wealth purely through accumulation of assets, rather than direct income, are contributing to the economy whilst avoiding an unnecessary burden on the average family.

The rate of Asset Tax for individuals will be harmonized with the rate of tax on earned income, and all allowances for each will be pooled, in order to ensure that work is rewarded and incentivised to the same extent as investment.

### VAT

Investigate possible reforms to the way VAT is applied to goods and services with a view to making it less regressive and, ultimately, to remove the poorest from having to pay entirely. This may require renegotiating our obligations to the EU, which makes VAT compulsory for all member states.

### Inheritance

Increase inheritance tax as much as possible, and use the revenue to reduce income tax (as described above). This is on the principle that inheritance, even for those lucky enough to get it, is capricious and as the population ages increasingly likely to arrive too late to be of any use. Instead, we prefer to have more money while working.


## Social Security

We will support research into a [universal basic income](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income) and its effects on society and the economy, with the aim of eradicating poverty and providing a basic standard of living for all.

## Housing

Stamp Duty Land Tax (paid on house purchases) should be reformed, with tax band thresholds linked to the regional average house price. Purchases up to the regional average house price should be zero-rated. In addition, the 'slab' approach of current taxation will be changed to an incremental approach, where only the amount above a threshold is taxed at that rate.

## Business

Personal income tax is calculated on income generated prior to expenses being deducted. But in business, corporation tax is calculated on any profit generated after expenses have been deducted from income. It is proposed that a study is conducted into the feasability and fairness of calculating them both in the same way: either personal income tax being revised and only calculated after household costs have been deducted (ie taxing household surplus or amount put into savings rather than income), or corporation tax being calculated on the basis of revenue alone.

Given that there is a current tax gap (between tax due and tax recieved by the exchequer) of [£120 billion](http://www.taxresearch.org.uk/Documents/FAQ1TaxGap.pdf), we propose the introduction of [country-by-country reporting](http://www.taxresearch.org.uk/Documents/CBC.pdf) and a [general anti-avoidance principle](http://www.taxresearch.org.uk/Blog/2012/06/20/why-we-need-a-genuine-general-anti-avoidance-principle-to-beat-tax-abuse-2/), in order to ensure that everyone living or doing business in the UK pays all the tax they owe.

## Digital Economy

We will extend the requirement on basic, affordable telephony to broadband to help ensure homes have sufficient access to the internet and to keep pace with the connected digital economy.

Enshrine net neutrality in law, protecting the fundamental principle of the free and open web.

Any data or research that is government funded will be required to be released under the Open Government License, ensuring that public funding equals public ownership. There will be an exception for government loans and innovation investment.

## Metric System

We will complete the metrification of the UK started in 1965, but never completed. The remaining uses of imperial units should be phased out and replaced with the modern metric equivalent, as recommended by the [UK Metric Association](http://metric.org.uk/).

## Government Contracts

Ensure worker-owned cooperatives and mutuals are given priority with all government contracts.

All private companies who receive public money must be subject to the same transparency requirements as governments when it comes to the goods and services they deliver[^1].

## Public Sector

In order to stimulate adoption of the living wage, and act as a good example, all public sector organisations and [National Infrastructure Organisations](infrastructure.html) will be required to pay employees at least a living wage.

## Tax Havens

Close down all tax havens under British jurisdiction. This means reforming tax rules in the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man, the Cayman Islands, the British Virgin Islands, and others.

In parallel, work at an international level to get rid of tax havens outside British jurisdiction, and close international loopholes such as the "Double Irish Dutch Sandwich".

## P2P Open Source Currency and role of Central Bank?

We will instruct HM Treasury to produce a roadmap for the future of currency and the role of central banks in a world with non-state-issued digital currencies, such as Bitcoin.

The central bank will be required to consider the reduction of inequality (as measured by the GINI coefficient) when formulating monetary policy to balance its existing remit of maintaining price stability and inflation at 2%.
